~ start
I just came home from my night run.
I was on autopilot for most of the run up until now...
I don't really remember what I was thinking about.
I think I went to the nearby campground and did my usual route.
Wait...
There's something in the mailbox...
A tape?
It was empty when I went out.
Who would deliver a tape this late?
Well, let's take a look at it...
